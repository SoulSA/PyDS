## What is this script?
<h4>This script will help you install all the required libraries to get you going as Data Scientist "If you are one!"
By using this script you will have all the following instaled on your Linux machine:</h4>

## Libraries:
|    Jupyter   | Testresources |    Wheel   | Pandas |  Numpy  |
|:------------:|:-------------:|:----------:|:------:|:-------:|
|     Scipy    |     Theano    |    Keras   |  Torch | Pybrain |
| Scikit-Learn |   Matplotlib  | Tensorflow | Cython | Seaborn |
|     Bokeh    |     Plotly    |    NLTK    | Gensim |  Scrapy |
|  Statsmodels |      Kivy     |   OpenCV   |  Pydot |   ---   |

<h4> It will install all libraries for both Python2 & Python3</h4>

## Tested?
<h4> This script has only been tested on Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS bionic </h4>
<h4> It will do all the work in the background, and you will be able to see what is installing</h4>
<h4> An "output.txt" file will be created on your desktop and you can check it to see if there was any errors in the process.</h4>
<h4> I am not a professional, but I wanted to do something, and I am looking forward for any feedback or<br>conterbution to this script</h4>

## Future Work
<h4> I want to make sure that this script works without errors, and I want to make it work on more linux distros.</h4>
<h4> I know there is Anaconda to do this kind of thing, but this is something that I feel would be nice to have it around.<br>You have a fresh install of your Linux, just run this script and let it install everything for you.</h4>

## Please give it a try!
<h4> If you are a linux user, give this script a try and give me feedback so I can try and make it better. Also, you can contribute and share your contribution with me.<br>If you can make it work on other Linux distros, that would be great.</h4>

<h3> Hope some of you would find this helpful, happy DS.</h4>
